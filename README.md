* It's best to view the lab guide on GitHub just as you do during the course
* You can view the slides offline if you download/clone this repository, ensure the project is unzipped, and view the **HTML files** in a web browser.  You do not open the `.md` files!  
* Viewing the slides is best with Firefox, but possible with Chrome with including `chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files`
